# UserValidationXamarin

2. This is a simple Xamarin Forms project, which takes an input from the user and returns with details.

3. Project simply demonstrates MVVM techniques without any framework. 

4. Working on Unit tests, will update soon. 

5. Suggestions and appropriate criticism are always welcome.

6. I do not want to integrate any 3rd party framework to achieve MVVM behaviour in this project, wish to keep it clean.

7. This project was made for study purpose and to understand the core MVVM techniques. 

8. Tech used -
